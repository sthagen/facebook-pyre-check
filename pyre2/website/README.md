# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

## Local Development

IMPORTANT: If you want to test any sandbox functionalities, you should be
developing on your local machine. This is because we rely on cargo, which can
only be built locally right now.

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Start a local development server:

```bash
$ ./start.sh
```

Go to the following uri in your browser:

```
localhost:3000
```

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
