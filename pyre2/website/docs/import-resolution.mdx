# Import Resolution

This doc describes how imports in a given file are found and their bindings are
resolved, including files that are being type checked.

NOTE: see the [Configuration documentation](configuration.mdx) for more info on
the config items referenced below.

## Relative Imports

If the import is relative (starting with one or more dots), the import is
resolved relative to the path of the file importing it. A single dot at the
beginning of the import (e.g. `.file.to.import`) represents the current
directory, and more dots (e.g. `..other.file`) will continue to walk upward.

## Absolute Imports

For absolute imports, Pyrefly uses the following import strategy:

1. Try to import from each entry in `import_roots` in the order they appear
   using the module finding strategy. a. NOTE: we append the config file's
   directory to `search_roots` automatically when using a config file as a
   sensible last-resort for attempting an import.
2. Try to import from `typeshed`.
3. Try to import from each entry in `site_package_path` in the order it appears
   using the module finding strategy.
4. Return an import error.

# Stub Files vs Source Files

A
[stub file](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-files)
is any file that ends with a `.pyi` file suffix. They have many uses, including
adding typing to non-Python extension code, distributing typing information
separate from implementation, or overriding an implementation with more accurate
typing information.

Pyrefly loads typing information from imports by first searching for a relevant
`.pyi` file, then falling back to a `.py` file, for each attempt at an import
above.
