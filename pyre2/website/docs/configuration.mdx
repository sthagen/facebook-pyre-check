# Pyrefly Configuration

Pyrefly has a basic configuration that can (or will) allow you to customize your Pyrefly runs without having to specify all of your arguments on the command line.

NOTE: this is early in its development, so the options listed here are subject to change in name, type, quantity, and structure.

Configurations can be specified in a `pyre.toml` file, with all configuration options in the top-level of the document. You can also speficy a configuration in a `pyproject.toml` under a `[tool.pyrefly]` section.

NOTE: At the moment, configuration finding is not supported. It will be implemented in the near future. In the meantime, please explicitly specify your configuration with the `-c <config>` or `--config <config>` flags when running Pyrefly.

Both absolute and config-relative paths are supported.

WARNING: running Pyrefly from a directory other than that which its configuration is defined in will result in strange behavior with relative path definitions. We plan to fix this in the next couple of weeks.

## Precendence in Options

The following is the order in which configuration options are selected:
1. CLI flag
2. Environment variable override -- This is the same as `PYRE_<CLI flag name>`
3. Configuration option
4. Hard-coded default

# Configuration Options

- `project_includes`: the patterns used to describe which files to type check, typically understood as user-space files. This takes highest precedence in import resolution.
  - Type: list of Unix Glob patterns
  - Default: `["./**/*.py"]`
  - Flag equivalent: Equivalent to `FILES...`
- `search_roots`: a file path describing a root from which imports should be found and imported from. This this takes second highest precedence in import resolution, after `project_includes`, but before `typeshed` and `site_package_path`.
  - Type: list of directories
  - Default: `["."]`
  - Flag equivalent: `--include` (soon changing to `--search-roots`), `-I`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_INCLUDE`
- `site_package_path`: a file path describing a root from which imports should be found and imported from. This takes the lowest priority in import resolution, after `project_includes`, `typeshed`,  and `search_roots`.
  - Type: list of directories
  - Default: `["."]`
  - Flag equivalent: `--site-package-path`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH`
- `python_platform`: the value used with conditions based on type checking against [`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform) values.
  - Type: string
  - Default: `"linux"`
  - Flag equivalent: `--python-platform`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_PYTHON_PLATFORM`
- `python_version`: the value used with conditions based on type checking against [`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version) values. The format should be `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`, where minor and micro can be omitted to take the default positional value.
  - Type: string
  - Default: `3.13.0`
  - Flag equivalent: `--python-version`
  - ENV equivalent: `PYRE_PYTHON_VERSION`
