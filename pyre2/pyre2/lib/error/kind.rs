/// ErrorKind categorizes an error by the part of the spec the error is related to.
/// They are used in suppressions to identify which error should be suppressed.
//
// Keep ErrorKind sorted lexographically, except for Unsupported and Unknown.
// There are broad categories of error kinds, based on the word used in the name.
// "Bad": Specific, straightforward type errors. Could be a disagreement with a source
//    of truth, e.g. a function definition is how we determine a call has errors.
// "Missing": Same as "Bad" but we know specifically that something is missing.
// "Invalid": Something is being used incorrectly, such as a typing construct or language feature.
// "SomethingError": Generally targeted on very specific error conditions. The "Error"
//    part may be dropped, e.g. in NotAType.
// These categories are flexible; use them for guidance when naming new ErrorKinds, but
// go with what feels right.
