/// * `read`, where you and many others can simultaneously
///   read the contents of the value. If someone else is writing, you wait.
/// * `exclusive`, given a read lock you can upgrade to an exclusive lock,
///   where you are the only person who can write. If someone else has an
///   exclusive lock then upgrading will fail after waiting til they lose
///   exclusivity.
/// * `write`, given an exclusive lock, you can write.
///
/// The aim is to allow other readers, even though you are mutating
/// a subset of the state.

/// When upgrading to an exclusive lock, you provide a value which must
/// match the currently locked value, or you will be rejected.
