(** The library provides logic for starting a code navigation Pyre server.

    Code navigation server is different from a traditional Pyre server in the following
    perspectives:

    - Code navigation server is lazier. It attempts to skip as much upfront computation as possible,
      and perform the least amount of necessary building and code analysis only when relevant
      information is queried by the user.
    - Code navigation server is not expected to interact with end users directly. Its primary focus
      is to serve downstream language toolings like linters and IDEs. *)

(** {1 Path translation} *)

(** This module defines the interfaces for a build system.

    From Pyre's perspective, a build system is defined as a component that remaps file paths: it
    allows the type checker to view a source file with certain path (i.e. the "source path") as a
    file with some other path (i.e. the "artifact path"). File paths matter for the type checker
    since it affects how Python modules are qualified.

    According to the definition above, a build system must provide interfaces that allow its client
    to query the associations between source paths and artifact paths. Since these associations may
    change throughout the lifetime of a Pyre server, additional hooks are also provided to allow
    clients to refresh them, if necessary. *)

  (** {1 External Interfaces} *)

  (** [update_working_set build_system source_paths] notifies [build_system] that the current
      working set may be changed. The [source_paths] argument specifies the set of files whose
      source mapping needs to be included in the build (usually this would correspond to the set of
      currently opened files, and an update is needed whenever a file gets opened or closed).

      This function and {!update_sources} are expected to handle different kinds of events. This
      function should be invoked when files are added to or removed from the current working set
      (e.g. a file is opened or closed by the editor). {!update_sources} should be invoked when
      files are detected to be changed on the filesystem (e.g. a file is saved by the editor). Since
      a file save could possibly affect what gets included in a build, {!update_sources} may or may
      not invoke this function under the hood. But this function will never invoke {!update_sources}
      as working set change would never alter the contents of files in the set.

      files get changed and how.

      This function and {!update_working_set} are expected to handle different kinds of events.
      {!update_working_set} should be invoked when files are added to or removed from the current
