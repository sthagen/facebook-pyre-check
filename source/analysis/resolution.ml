(* A Resolution.t value represents all of the type information in a local scope. In Pyre, every
   expression can potentially have a distinct Resolution.t because side effects of evaluating parts
   of an expression can lead to type refinement (for example ternary expressions) or the
   introduction of new names (for example the walrus operator or the placeholder variables in a
   comprehension).

   If you only neeed *global* scope information, then use GlobalResolution.t rather than
   Resolution.t *)
