(* PyrePysaAnalysis is a sort of choke-point for all Pysa uses of Pyre's `Analysis`
 * *functions*. Its purpose is mainly to better enable coordination and planning:
 * by always using `PyrePysaAnalysis.some_function_name` rather than using `Analysis`
 * directly we allow Pyre and Pysa contributors to:
 * - see at a glance all of the functionality used directly by Pysa
 * - much more easily search for where and how such functionality is used
 *
 * Having this ability to more clearly see all of the dependencies is very helpful
 * for considering how we might loosen the coupling - in particular, we want to
 * understand what else would be needed if we exposed a high-quality typed AST.
