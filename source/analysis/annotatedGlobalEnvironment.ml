(* AnnotatedGlobalEnvironment: layer of the environment stack
 * - upstream: AttributeResolution
 * - downstream: TypeEnvironment
 *   - also used by GlobalResolution, which is not an environment
 *     layer per se but is an interface in between type checking and
 *     all lower layers.
 * - key: name of a global, as a Reference.t
 * - value: Location.WithModule.t option
 *
 * This layer of the environment handles location information for globals,
 * which is needed in type checking. The lower-level layers all ignore location
 * in their invalidation logic, which is why we need this layer (so that we
 * know to re-compute errors that include locations after line number changes).
 *
 * Note: The name is not related to location information - that's because
 * it is named mostly for how it is used: it's the last environment
 * layer *prior* to type checking, that contains information we can
 * compute with just simple processing of sources rather than expensive
 * constraint solving.
