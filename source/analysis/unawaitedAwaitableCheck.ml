(** This module allows us to statically catch `RuntimeWarning`s that "coroutine `foo` was never
    awaited".

    Usual Pyre type errors are for catching runtime `TypeError`s. Pyre is considered "sound" iff
    Pyre emitting no type errors implies that there are no runtime `TypeError`s.

    This module extends the same notion to coroutine `RuntimeWarning`s as well.

    In an *ideal* world, if Pyre does not emit any unawaited-awaitable errors, then there should not
    be any `RuntimeWarning`s about coroutines never being awaited. However, to be practical, we may
    relax our checks in some cases to avoid noisy false positives. For example, in classes that
    inherit from `Awaitable`, we don't emit an error when assigning an awaitable to an attribute,
    because that led to many false positives in widely-used frameworks. So, the above notion of
    soundness is an ideal we are tending towards, but by no means a hard guarantee.

    Strategy: Reaching-definitions analysis + ownership analysis

    1. Reaching-definitions analysis: We want to find out which awaitables are not awaited by the
    time the function returns (at least along some code path).

    - If an awaitable is awaited in some expression, then the awaitable doesn't reach the return
      point of the function. We can say that the `await` "kills" the "reach" of the awaitable.

    - If the awaitable is never awaited along some code path, then it reaches the return statement
      and is thus an unawaited awaitable.

    We can think of the original awaitable as a "definition". Getting all definitions that reach a
    certain point without being "killed" in between is called reaching-definition analysis.

    In our case, a "definition" is an awaitable expression (more precisely, its location in the
    code). "Killing" or consuming an awaitable means doing one of the following:

    - using `await` on it, which consumes it directly.
    - passing it in a function call, which transfers ownership (the callee should consume it).
    - yeilding or returning it, which transfers ownership to a calling / consuming scope.

    We want all definitions (awaitables) that reach the return point of the function without being
    killed (awaited or otherwise consumed).

    Reaching-definitions analysis means we need a forward analysis. For more details, see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaching_definition.

    2. Ownership (specifically *shared* ownership, or aliasability) analysis: Awaitables can be
    stored in variables. If we await any variable that it has been assigned to (or any variable to
    which those variables have been assigned), then we should mark the original awaitable as
    awaited. So, whenever we detect that a variable is being assigned some other variable, we copy
    over all the awaitables that are pointed to by the other variable. *)

(* Return true if the expression is of an awaitable type that will lead to a `RuntimeWarning` that
   `coroutine ... was never awaited`.

   Note that this is more restrictive than the general question of "does this type satisfy the
   Awaitable protocol?", which just needs to check for the `__await__` method. However, this matches
   our goal of catching potential RuntimeWarnings about unawaited coroutines. Otherwise, we would
   emit an error for entire class hierarchies where the base class happens to have a `__await__`
   method, since that means every class in the hierarchy will satisfy the `Awaitable` protocol. That
   has caused a lot of noise in the past for basic functions such as:

   def set_foo(builder: BuilderClass, foo: Foo) -> BuilderClass: ...

   which is seen as a function returning an awaitable, since `BuilderClass` satisfies `Awaitable`.
   Given that there is no RuntimeWarning for classes with hand-rolled `__await__`, we can leave them
   out of our analysis. *)

  | _ -> false


(* In order to do reachability and aliasability analysis at the same time, it is helpful to track
   the state (reachability) of an awaitable separately from the ownership (aliasability), and only
   move between them when we are ready to consume (or "kill" in reachability vocab) all the
   awaitables tracked by some owner.

   This requires using two separate maps to track them, and we need a persistent identifier for
   them. So we key awaitables based on the location of the *originator* expression where they were
   first introduced. This originator location remains the same even as ownership can bubble up (and
   be aggregated, i.e. one owner can track many separate originators) into larger expressions or
   into variables by way of assignment.

   For example:

   - in `await asyncio.gather(awaitable())` we will store the location of the `awaitable()` call as
   the `Awaitable.t` originator, even as ownership bubbles up to the `asyncio.gather` expression
   (and awaitability gets "consumed" when that owner is awaited)

   - in `x = awaitable()` we will store the location of the `awaitable()` call as the `Awaitable.t`
   originator, even though ownership will be transferred to the name `x` (and awaitability can
   eventually be consumed if we consume x by awaiting it, returning it, or passing it as an argument
   in a call). *)

  (* In order to analyze awaitables statically, we have to handle the propagation of
   * (shared) ownership of awaitables. This can happen in two ways:
   * - ownership can bubble outward through complex expressions that contain awaitable
   *   sub-expressions.
   *   - in most cases we don't currently need ownership to model this, we just
   *     track it using the `nested_awaitable_subexpressions` data in the
   *     `forward_expression_result` type.
   *   - but the current way handle interactions between `forward_call` and the
   *     consuming logic in `forward_expression` requires us to invent anonymous
   *     owners for chained method calls such as `create_awaitable().set_x(x)`.
   *     We use these anonymous owners so that we can mark the awaitable originating
   *     at `create_awaitable()` as awaited if the entire chained-method-call
   *     expression is awaited. The `AnonymousExpression` variant handles this.
   * - assignments (including subscript assignments) can propagate awaitables into
   *   variables, which unlike expressions can be awaited much later (i.e. in later
   *   statements); in addition, knowing the owning variable name can help make error
   *   messages more informative. This is handled by the `NamedOwner` variant.
   *
   * This notion of ownership is similar to Rust's but is more lax because we are
   * only trying to ensure that awaitables are *plausibly* waited *at least* once rather
   * than *definitely* waited *exactly* once.
   *
   * As a result, we allow the same awaitable to have multiple owners. For example:
   * ```
   * x = awaitable0()
   * d["x"] = x
   * ```
   * leads to both `x` and `d` tracking the awaitable originating at the expression
   * `awaitable()`, and consuming either `x` *or* `d` will lead to us marking it as
   * plausibly consumed.
   *
   * And since our analysis only cares about consuming *at least* once, we won't
   * complain if code tries to consume both `x` and `d`, for example by
   * awaiting both. This is an intentional choice - consuming an awaitable
   * twice typically leads to a pretty clear-cut runtime error, and our priority
   * here is attempting to statically catch the silent failures that happen when
   * an awaitable is never consumed.)
