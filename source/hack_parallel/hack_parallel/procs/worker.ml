 * Module building workers
 *
 * A worker is a subprocess executing an arbitrary function
 *
 * You should first create a fixed amount of workers and then use those
 * because the amount of workers is limited and to make the load-balancing
 * of tasks better (cf multiWorker.ml)
 *
 * On Unix, we "spawn" workers when initializing Hack. Then, this
 * worker, "fork" an ephemeral worker for each incoming request. The forked
 * wephemeral worker will die after processing a single request. (We use this
 * two-layer architecture because, *if* the long-lived worker was created when the
 * original process was still very small, those forks run much faster than forking
 * off the original process which will eventually have a large heap).
 *
 * A worker never handle more than one request at a time.
