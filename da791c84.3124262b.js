When working with functions defined outside your project, where\nyou don't directly see the source, you can use ",Object(s.b)("a",Object(a.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"/docs/querying-pyre"}),Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"a"},"pyre query")),"\nwith the ",Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"signature")," argument to have Pysa dump it's internal model of a\nfunction, so you know exactly how to write your model."),Object(s.b)("h4",{id:"eliding"},"Eliding"),Object(s.b)("p",null,"As you can see from the above examples, unmodelled parameters and function bodies can\nboth be elided with ",Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"..."),". Additionally, type annotations ",Object(s.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," be entirely\nomitted (not replaced with ",Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"..."),"), even when present on the declaration of the\nfunction. This is done to make parsing taint annotations unambiguous."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},91:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",(function(){return u})),n.d(t,"b",(function(){return h}));var a=n(0),i=n.n(a);function s(e,t,n){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:n,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=n,e}function o(e,t){var n=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(a=a.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),n.push.apply(n,a)}return n}function r(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var n=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?o(Object(n),!0).forEach((function(t){s(e,t,n[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(n)):o(Object(n)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(n,t))}))}return e}function l(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,i=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,i={},s=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<s.length;a++)n=s[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(i[n]=e[n]);return i}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var s=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<s.length;a++)n=s[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(i[n]=e[n])}return i}var c=i.a.createContext({}),p=function(e){var t=i.a.useContext(c),n=t;return e&&(n="function"==typeof e?e(t):r(r({},t),e)),n},u=function(e){var t=p(e.components);return i.a.createElement(c.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},d={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,{},t)}},b=i.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var n=e.components,a=e.mdxType,s=e.originalType,o=e.parentName,c=l(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),u=p(n),b=a,h=u["".concat(o,".").concat(b)]||u[b]||d[b]||s;return n?i.a.createElement(h,r(r({ref:t},c),{},{components:n})):i.a.createElement(h,r({ref:t},c))}));function h(e,t){var n=arguments,a=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||a){var s=n.length,o=new Array(s);o[0]=b;var r={};for(var l in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,l)&&(r[l]=t[l]);r.originalType=e,r.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:a,o[1]=r;for(var c=2;c<s;c++)o[c]=n[c];return i.a.createElement.apply(null,o)}return i.a.createElement.apply(null,n)}b.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
